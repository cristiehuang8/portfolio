                    <h3>Starting at a Startup</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I didn't know what to expect going into my first product design internship at a startup. With
                        Grabbd, a social travel app,
                        I had the incredible opportunity to absorb the bustling startup culture during their exciting
                        app relaunch.
                        As the only product design intern on the team, I took full ownership of user testing and
                        high-fidelity design experimentation. Since I wore many hats, I even had the chance to practice
                        my graphic design skills
                        by designing Grabbd merch and launched a brand new college ambassador program to expand our
                        social media reach!
                    </p>

                    <div class="sub-section">
                        <h3>User Testing</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            The relaunch of the app was the biggest design change that Grabbd had ever seen, and we
                            wanted to gain the feedback from both
                            new users (who had ever seen the app before) and existing users.

                                changed the Grabbd experience. </li>

                        After sketching some low-fidelity screens, I created high-fidelity explorations while keeping
                        the visuals consistent
                        with the brand identity. Unfortunately I can't get into any more detail about the work that I
                        did, since it's under NDA.

                    <h3>Some Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="grabbd"><span class="grabbd-emph-text">Fully understand the context and business
                                priorities before designing.</span> When I jumped straight into designing without
                            understanding the context of the problem, I quickly found that my assumptions often didn't
                            align with my project manager's
                            vision. Understanding Grabbd's priorities and context made it much easier to design and
                            <span class="emph-word">enhanced my confidence as a designer.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li class="grabbd"><span class="grabbd-emph-text">Work beyond the tasks given to you.</span>
                            While I was able to take ownership of the design tasks
                            that were assigned, I also wanted to explore <span class="emph-word">out-of-the-box
                                designs</span> that didn't quite fit Grabbd's priorities at the time. My side projects
                            trained me to
                            think outside the box and they ended up being considered for future implementations in the
                            app.
                        </li>
                        <li class="grabbd"><span class="grabbd-emph-text">Challenge your design decisions.</span> After
                            getting feedback for my first design iteration, I realized that there were
                            elements in my designs that were overcomplicated and unnecessary. As I'm brainstorming, I
                            need ask myself <span class="emph-word">"Why is this feature necessary?"</span> so that I
                            can have a clearer
                            focus as I'm designing.
