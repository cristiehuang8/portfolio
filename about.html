                        <p>I'm a junior at Cornell University studying <a
                                href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/bs-information-science-systems-and-technology">Information
                                Science, Systems, and Technology</a>, concentrating in Interactive Technologies and UX.
                            Currently, I am the Co-Founder and Head of Design for a startup called Cumulus, an edtech
                            platform that aims to
                            empower underrepresented minorities in high school to explore opportunities in tech. I am
                            also a product designer at Cornell
                            Design and Tech Initiative, where I design products for the Cornell community.
                            Last summer, I was a Product Design Intern for <a href="http://grabbd.com/">Grabbd</a>,
                            where I
                            conducted user research, analyzed user feedback, and recommended
                            high-fidelity design solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>My design journey began just earlier this year, when I took a product design class on a whim.
                            I spent
                            a semester learning UX/UI design principles, ultimately producing my first case study on
                            Facebook Messenger. I didn't expect that I would enjoy this
                            design process so much that I'd pursue a career in it, but for the first time in my life, I
                            saw
                            a clearer picture of what my career would look like— hundreds of colorful post-its on a
                            whiteboard and numerous
                            explorations and flows on Figma. I'm excited to utilize the momentum that I've gained from
                            these
                            first steps to launch my career in product design!
