                        <p>I'm a junior at Cornell University studying <a
                                href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/undergraduate/info-sci-majors/bs-information-science-systems-and-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Information
                                Science, Systems, and Technology</a>, concentrating in Interactive Technologies and UX.
                            Currently, I am the Co-Founder and Head of Design for a startup called Cumulus, an edtech
                            platform that aims to
                            empower underrepresented minorities in high school to explore opportunities in tech. I am
                            also a product designer at <a
                            href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell
                            Design and Tech Initiative</a>, where I design products for the Cornell community.
                            Last summer, I was a Product Design Intern for <a href="http://grabbd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grabbd</a>,
                            where I
                            conducted user research, analyzed user feedback, and recommended
                            high-fidelity design solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>My design journey began just last year, when I took a Pass/Fail introductory product design class on a whim.
                             I didn't expect that I would enjoy design so much that I'd pursue a career in it, but for the first time in my life, I
                            saw a clearer picture of what my career would look like— hundreds of colorful post-its on a
                            whiteboard and numerous explorations on Figma. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seeing how much I've changed as a designer since my first exposure to design, I can't wait to continue learning from my talented peers, colleagues, 
                            and mentors in my ongoing mission to design impactful human experiences. 
                        </p>
