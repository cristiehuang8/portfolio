                <h3>Left on Read (again)</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">“Was it something I said?” We all know the dreadful feeling of
                    being left on read in the middle of a text conversation. Until the next inevitable
                    message comes a couple of days later when the other person responds, claiming they forgot to
                    respond.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">Why does this happen? Why do users forget to respond to messages when we
                    have notification banners and “marking as unread” that aim to prevent forgetfulness?
                    When
                    people message each other on Messenger, they want to maintain a natural flow in conversation by
                    following
                    up in a timely manner, but can’t do that well because:

                <p class="paragraph">With this problem statement in mind, I conducted user research to further

                        Talking with these participants, I realized that Messenger doesn’t have a streamlined way to
                        communicate with a wide array of friends whose chats aren’t easily accessible on the main
                        screen.
                        Users want to maintain consistent communication with everyone, but find that the frequent influx
                        of
                        new connections and group chats ultimately results in delayed conversations and fizzled-out
                        communication.

                        How can Messenger maintain its casual messaging concept while holding users accountable for

                    I recruited some of my friends to help me brainstorm ways to improve consistent communication on
                    Messenger.
                    After exploring numerous ideas, we narrowed them down to three main opportunity areas:

                <ol>
                    <li>

                        increase engagement with older chats?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="emph-word">Message Reminders</p>: How might we encourage users to reply to the
                        messages they’ve seen?

                        group chats and connections?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    With these opportunity areas in mind, I came up with several potential solutions to address
                    inconsistencies in Messenger communication.

                <p class="emph-word">Starred Messages</p>: Users have the option to mark their friend’s message with a
                star so that if the user is busy at the

                soon.

                read a message but have not yet responded. The notification pops up next to the chat and the chat
                appears first in the main page, so that users can
                easily access it as soon as they open the app.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        After considering the impact and feasibility of these potential features, I decided to proceed
                        with
                        the Starred Messages feature. While the Follow-up Notifications feature is feasible, it may be
                        low
                        impact because users might deliberately choose to not respond to opened messages. The
                        End-of-Year
                        Analytics has relatively low feasibility and low impact, because users might not be inclined to
                        reach
                        out to old group chats after seeing the data. With these factors in mind, I moved forward with
                        the
                        Starred Messages feature.

                        I decided to change the star icon to be a checkbox instead, creating a Message Checklist on

                        page
                        so that users can “check off” the messages that they’ve replied to. After the initial round
                        of
                        explorations,
                        I studied how my user testing participants interacted with the designs.

                maintaining
                Messenger’s minimalistic layout.
                Of the four entry points, users gravitated towards entry point <p class="emph-word">A</p> since
                the

                        product
                        design similar to Messenger’s casual
                        style. I overcomplicated what is essentially a pinning feature by implementing checkboxes, which
                        were confusing to the users and unnecessary
                        to accomplish the ultimate goal of this feature: to remind users to respond messages they have
                        already seen. And thus began the rebranding
                        of this Message Checklist concept to what is now the Pinning feature.

                <h3>Pinpointing the Solution</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    With the concept of pins instead of checkboxes, I explored various ways of integrating the pins on
                    the home page and the pinned messages in the chat.
                    I kept in mind the importance of maintaining Messenger’s fun and casual messaging concept by
                    matching the pinning feature to the existing design and UI of Messenger.

                    From my user feedback, I also realized that users not only want to pin specific messages, but they
                    also want to pin whole chats directly from the main screen without
                    having to tap into the chat first. In my final iteration of explorations, I also considered
                    different ways to pin and unpin both messages and chats.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Looking back at my overall project journey, I started with an initial "starring" concept for
                    organizing messages, then pivoted to the message
                    checklist feature, and finally landed on this pinning feature. This pinning feature combines both
                    the prioritizing aspect of the starring feature
                    as well as the feeling of accountability in the checklist feature. While it was at times frustrating
                    to hit roadblocks like these initial ideas that
                    didn't feel as impactful as I'd like, I quickly learned that this is part of the beauty of design:
                    iteration.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    This was my first case study and exposure to product design, and I can't wait to apply the
                    foundational skills I gained to more projects in the near future!
