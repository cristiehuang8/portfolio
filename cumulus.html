                <h3>Diversity & Inclusion in Tech</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Why don't we see more underrepresented minorities in the tech industry? While universities are
                    constantly striving for diverse
                    student bodies in STEM, why can't graduated minorities break into tech? These were questions
                    that our team asked each other,
                    and we struggled to answer these questions.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To address this problem, we decided to target the beginning of our career journeys: high school.
                    I felt that while my high school was a great place for me to hone my foundational academic skills,
                    my school contributed very little in my career discovery journey. I can only imagine how much
                    more difficult it must be
                    for underrepresented minorities and low-income students to navigate the daunting task of
                    discovering your career passion.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We hypothesize that underrepresented minorities in high school may be unaware and/or discouraged
                    from pursuing opportunities in tech because:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>They don't see anyone who looks like them in tech.</li>
                    <li>They don't have adequate career resources from their school.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Reaching out to our high school teachers, counselors, and other local school districts, we sent
                        out
                        a survey for high school students to
                        learn more about their career exploration experiences.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        After surveying 63 minorities in high schools across the country, we found that a majority of
                        them
                        are still unsure about what field they want to
                        pursue in the future. Even more interesting was the free-response answers to the question "What
                        has
                        been the most challenging obstacle for you as a
                        student to learn more about and get more involved in the tech industry?"

                    step-by-step in the learning process as shown in the screens above. Students can get a basic
                    overview of the field, meet with an industry

                <h3>From Concept to Launch</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We started our Cumulus journey with one awkward video call among 5 strangers who met online, to now,
                    a strong,
                    motivated founding team of our newly created startup.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Coming out of the project jam, we met with startup incubators to gain more constructive feedback
                    about our product
                    and to learn suggested next steps. So far, I've learned that there's so much more to launching a
                    product than just
                    the UX— we have to develop a strong customer base, create a business plan for monetization, and roll
                    out a barebones MVP before
                    we even start thinking about developing the product I had envisioned.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    This was the first project in which I had led the design effort, and I look forward to eventually
                    launching the product
                    with my team.
