                <h3>Product Buds Project Jam</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Interested in learning more about product management, I joined Product Buds, an online community of
                     aspiring product managers. I signed up for the Project Jam, a three-month competition where I was immersed 
                     in a collaborative product development process with my team. After conducting user research, brainstorming ideas, prototyping an MVP, 
                     and preparing a pitch deck, our team was chosen to be one of the finalists to present our pitch deck on Demo Day to judges and 150+ other attendees.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Participants first pitched their interests or product concepts, and teams of 5-6 were formed based on 
                    similar areas of interest. Designing for social impact, especially regarding diversity and inclusion, particularly 
                    resonates with me, so I joined a team of like-minded designers, engineers, and business students to take on this challenge. 
                </p>

                <p class="section-label">PROBLEM</p>
            </div>
            <div class="main-section">
                <h3>Diversity & Inclusion in Tech</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Why don't we see more underrepresented minorities in the tech industry? While universities are constantly striving for diverse 
                    student bodies in STEM, why can't graduated minorities break into tech? These were questions that our team asked each other, 
                    and we struggled to answer these questions. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To address this problem, we decided to target the beginning of our career journeys: high school. During our meetings we 
                    talked about our own high school experiences and how collectively we weren't aware of the career possibilities in tech until later in college. 
                    Having gone through the trial-and-error process to figure out what I wanted to do, I felt that while my high school was a great place for me to hone my foundational academic skills, 
                    my school contributed very little in my career discovery journey. I can only imagine how much more difficult it must be 
                    for underrepresented minorities and low-income students to navigate the daunting task of discovering your career passion.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    We hypothesize that underrepresented minorities in high school may be unaware and/or discouraged from pursuing opportunities in tech because:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>They don't see anyone who looks like them in tech.</li>
                    <li>They don't have adequate career resources from their school.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Reaching out to our high school teachers, counselors, and other local school districts, we sent out a survey for high school students to 
                    learn more about their career exploration experiences. 
                </p>
                    <img class= "reg-case-pic" src="images/cumulus_research.png" alt="User Research">

                        User research display from our pitch deck
                    </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After surveying 63 minorities in high schools across the country, we found that a majority of them are still unsure about what field they want to 
                    pursue in the future. Even more interesting was the free-response answers to the question "What has been the most challenging obstacle for you as a 
                    student to learn more about and get more involved in the tech industry?"
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    "How career choices aren’t cut dry relations to what you learned in high school.""
                </p>
                <p class="quote-right">
                    "I wish I had more access to a consolidated source of information."
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    "Where to start."
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After analyzing the quantative and qualitative survey responses, it became clear that underrepresented minorities in high school didn't have  
                    sufficient career resources to guide their plans for their futures. We were able to narrow our focus to these 3 pain points:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Students don't receive personalized career guidance from their high school counselors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Students are overwhelmed by a plethora of online resources.</li>
                    <li>Students don’t understand how subjects and majors translate into careers.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Persona</h3>
                <img src="images/persona2.png" alt="Persona">
                <p class="paragraph">To guide our brainstorming in the next phase of the project, we created a persona named Ruby, whose 
                    goals and challenges match those we surveyed during user research.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    I facilitated a Crazy Eights exercise where each person sketches 8 frames that could be used as starting points for our medium-fidelity explorations.

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After presenting our own sketches and voting on our favorite screens, we decided to further explore three main 
                    features:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p class="emph-word">Resources</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="emph-word">Mentorship</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="emph-word">Community</p> 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    After long meetings talking about the million directions we could take with this problem space, we felt excited that we 
                    could agree on these main features and get started on designing the prototype. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    With a product vision in mind, we were able to brainstorm the name of our platform. Someone had mentioned before that 
                    we wanted to "uncloud" the tech industry because a lot of high school students aren't aware of opportunities in tech. Running 
                    with the idea of clouds, we fell in love with the name <span style="color: #8FACE2; font-family: montserrat-medium">Cumulus</span>. Cumulus clouds, after all, are associated with pleasant weather 
                    and sunny skies— indicative of our students’ bright futures.
                </p>
                <h3>Medium Fidelity</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Using the chosen low fidelity screens from our brainstorming exercise, we discussed content requirements for each of the main features. 
                </p>
                <img class="large-pic" src="images/resources3.png" alt="Resources">
                <p class="pic-text">Step-by-step major exploration path</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <p class="emph-word">Major Exploration:</p> We found that many students feel lost and overwhelmed with the limitless resources available to them online, 
                    that they don't even know where to start. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    With Cumulus, students can learn about various fields with our "explorations". For each major exploration, we take students 
                    step-by-step in the learning process as shown in the screens above. Students can get a basic overview of the field, meet with an industry 
                    professional in the field, dive deeper in our recommended external resources, and finally reflect on their learning experience for future reference. 
                    These explorations are a comprehensive and accessible way to explore various perspectives in a field.

                <img class="large-pic" src="images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard">
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <p class="emph-word">Dashboard:</p> When I first envisioned the dashboard (Screen A), I wanted to keep it straightforward with 4 main buttons to 
                    toggle between explorations, connections, communities, and mentors. However, when I considered that community and networking was going to be an element 
                    of our platform, I realized that a public profile was necessary for the user. However, in Screen B, the profile section and the dashboard section clashed. I decided to choose Screen C, 
                    where I integrated both the profile and the dashboard to highlight the user's information while allowing the user to conveniently keep track of their exploration progress. 
                </p>
                <img class="large-pic" src="images/community.png" alt="Community">
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <p class="emph-word">Communities:</p> We wanted to elevate the typical group community from platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook by highlighting posts from mentors and 
                    encouraging an inclusive forum for underrepresented minorities to network, ask questions, and form friendships. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I struggled with designing the Community page because I had to separate the community information from the actual forum and posts. 
                    With Screen A, I tried out a simplistic layout, with the details in the top section. However, I wanted to make the page less cluttered, so 
                    I split it into three subpages to split up the content in Screen B.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    With the main features of our platform, we realized that one problem was left unsolved: students don't know where to start with their career search.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Utilizing information we gathered from research papers about how soft skills and personal interests correlate to 
                    future career paths, we created an aptitude quiz that users take when they first sign into Cumulus. The quiz would 
                    act as a starting point that suggests careers to explore first, then as users continue to pivot from those fields into related or 
                    unrelated fields, they can cover a wide range of recommended fields for them.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We started our Cumulus journey with one awkward video call among 5 strangers who met online, to now, a strong, 
                    motivated founding team of our newly created startup. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Coming out of the project jam, we met with startup incubators to gain more constructive feedback about our product 
                    and to learn suggested next steps. So far, I've learned that there's so much more to launching a product than just 
                    the UX— we have to develop a strong customer base, create a business plan for monetization, and roll out a barebones MVP before 
                    we even start thinking about developing the product I had envisioned.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    This was the first project in which I had led the design effort, and I look forward to eventually launching the product 
                    with my team.
